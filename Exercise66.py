####Exercise 51 included a table that shows the conversion from letter grades 
####to grade points at a particular academic institution. 

# In this exercise you will compute the grade point average of an arbitrary number of letter grades entered
# by the user. The user will enter a blank line to indicate that all of the grades have been provided. 
# For example, if the user enters A, followed by C+, followed by B, followed by a blank line then your program
# should report a grade point average of 3.1.
